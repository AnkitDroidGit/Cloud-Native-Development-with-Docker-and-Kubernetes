# Cloud-Native-Development-with-Docker-and-Kubernetes

While the vast majority of Node.js apps are deployed and run in the cloud, few leverage all that modern cloud computing platforms have to offer. If you're looking to take the next step in your cloud computing journey,

## Learning objectives

- Using Node.js in the cloud
- Creating a Node.js app
- Building a production Dockerfile
- Deploying an app to Kubernetes using Helm
- Adding self-healing capabilities
- Building custom charts and graphs
- Adding support for metrics and request tracking

## What is Cloud Native ?

Lets undersnatd this by answering few questions

### 1. What does "cloud native" mean?

- Before we can describe cloud native, we first need to talk about cloud computing, what it provides and how to use that to understand what cloud native really means.
- So why cloud computing? Wikipedia describes cloud computing as "the on-demand availability of cloud system resources."
- It also helps to minimize upfront IT infrastructure costs because you don't need to buy and provision hardware for the amount of work that you are banked to do, you only need to provide hardware and buy resource for what you are currently using.
- So cloud computing provides a managed platform that's infinitely scalable and always available and compute on demand.
- As we move into the cloud, microservices become a possibility. Martin Fowler, one of the thought leaders for microservices, describes them as "a suite of small services "that run on their own "and communicate with each other "using lightweight mechanisms"
